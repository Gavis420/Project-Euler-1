/*
* If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples
* of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. 
* Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
*/

//ideas for solution:
// use loop for multiplication method. meaning:
// multiply 3 x i until it is >= 1000 and do the same with 5 x i until >= 1000. 
    // as you go either continually add the number to a growing total, or 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Prints hello world
    cout << "Hello World";

    return 0;
